# NationalAnthems

National Anthems (Europe) is an application which purpose is to give users easy access to National Anthems. 
The main screen displays a map on which markers assigned to countries are placed. 
And by only two clicks user can listen to the melody of a chosen anthem as well as read the lyrics.

Link to the app on the Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lutka.nationalanthems

Project dependencies:
- Google maps API – display region of the world (Europe)
- Google palette API – for assigning pin colors

The application covers only Europe it can be easily extended to cover the whole world
only by including more resources related to other world countries.

The resources so: Lyrics, audio files and flags comes from the internet mainly wikipedia, 
I have not created any of them only slightly edited by changing its size or length, etc.
