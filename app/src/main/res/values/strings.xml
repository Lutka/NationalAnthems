Soldiers are we,
whose lives are pledged to Ireland,
Some have come
from a land beyond the wave,
Sworn to be free,
no more our ancient sireland,
Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
Tonight we man the "bearna baoil",[fn 4]
In Erin\'s cause, come woe or weal,
’Mid cannon\'s roar and rifles\' peal,
We\'ll chant a soldier\'s song.
